------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas somewhere,
pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>, and
remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "development
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

coming *soon*:
- fixing the JavaScript for "select New (OVT|DVD|...)" in the edit menu:
  "cancel" shouldn't result in an error (but just a cancel or reload)
- Restore function should take care for changed/new categories (refering to
  them not via id but the internal name to correctly assign even detect changed
  ones, and having categories not yet existing added)
- Restore function should be able to ADD to existing entries by evaluating
  the mtype set with the imported movie, and then correctly increment the
  MediaNr while adding the movie. As with categories, new mediatypes should
  be added when needed.
- User should be able to change his/her password without having admin
  privileges

coming *next*:
- PS template(s) for DVD covers
- form(s) to edit label sheets (for PSLabels)
- store user-based preferences into a different table if no cookies are used

coming *sometimes* (maybe):
- movie language setting(s)
- honour date format settings in all places
- add "sample-links" to translation editor
- enable/disable a category (to temporarily get rid of unwanted ones)
- new database field: "lent to" (to find out where your media *really* are :)
- make menu template-driven
- configurable format of counter display: as is in db / in minutes / in hh:mm
  (same for length field)
- making out-sourcing of security relevant files (inc/*) possible
  (to e.g. put those files outside the web tree)
