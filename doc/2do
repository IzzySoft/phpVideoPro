This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas on the
bottom, pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>,
and remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "develoment
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

coming *soon*:
- translation for categories missing
- setup: check for existence and readability of SQL files before execution
- fields for counter settings (start/end of movie for old tape recorders
  (feature request by user via sourceforge))
- field for "commercials" (tri-state: yes/no/cut off manually)

coming *next*:
- limit list display to user-definable amount of data sets
- print lists function taking into account a user-definable page length
- label creating and printing function
- search function
- new database field: "lent to" (to find out where your media *really* are :)
- menue items for "change MediaNr" and "change MediaType"
- making categories editable (user-defined categories etc.)
- overview "per tape" (should look equivalent to taperest)
- adding *all* media types to cass table. This requires a new field
  (mtype) as well - and maybe we rename the table :)

coming *sometimes*:
- making out-sourcing of security relevant files (inc/*) possible
  (to e.g. put those files outside the web tree)
