------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas somewhere,
pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>, and
remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "development
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

coming *soon*:
- export-button for selected movie (view_entry) and selected movies (movie list)
  for transfer, similiar to a "partial backup"
- movie rating (0-5 stars where 0 is "not rated yet"), also in list (providing
  the possibility to "order by rating")
- import movie data from IMDB

coming *next*:
- PS template(s) for DVD covers
- form(s) to edit label sheets (for PSLabels)
- settings for NTSC/PAL
- "enhanced" [url] and [img] tags (like we use in phpDiveLog already)
- separate the view_entry template from the edit template to move all formating
  information from the PHP code into the template
- add Audio/Subtitle to filter settings
- add optional "Bubble Help" (via HTML "TITLE" attribute)

coming *sometimes* (maybe):
- honour date format settings in all places
- add "sample-links" to translation editor
- new database field: "lent to" (to find out where your media *really* are :)
- make menu template-driven
- configurable format of counter display: as is in db / in minutes / in hh:mm
  (same for length field)
- making out-sourcing of security relevant files (inc/*) possible
  (to e.g. put those files outside the web tree)
