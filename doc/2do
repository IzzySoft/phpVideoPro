------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas somewhere,
pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>, and
remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "development
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Focus:
- "enhanced" [url] and [img] tags (like we use in phpDiveLog already)
- "Rental Feature": Logged-in user clicks on "Lent to me" button => "Lent-to"
  field will be filled w/ his name, mail is sent to owner
- Letter shortcuts for translation editor (jump to code starting with letter)
- Backup/restore: FromUser/ToUser is missing now that every user may have his
  own records

Not scheduled (yet):
- user verification using .htaccess (for site integration: If authenticated,
  and user with same name exists, don't aks for the password again)
- add Audio/Subtitle to filter settings
- export-button for selected movie (view_entry) and selected movies (movie list)
  for transfer, similiar to a "partial backup"
- table names: consequent use of the pvp_ prefix for all tables (for users
  who only have one database with their provider)
- separate the view_entry template from the edit template to move all formating
  information from the PHP code into the template
- more optional "Bubble Help" (via HTML "TITLE" attribute)

Interesting things not scheduled at all:
- support for file-based formats like DivX, including play controls
  (links to start external Shell scripts, *.Cmd files or the like)
- PlugIn structure for 3rd party addons (like the PS templates), making PVP
  more modular and allowing removal of unwanted features
- PS template(s) for DVD covers
- form(s) to edit label sheets (for PSLabels)
- honour date format settings in all places
- add "sample-links" to translation editor
- configurable format of counter display: as is in db / in minutes / in hh:mm
  (same for length field)
