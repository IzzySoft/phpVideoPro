This ToDo-List is not ordered by anything: I just add new ideas on the bottom,
pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>, and
remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below could
be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity. If you
think there's something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the
feature request list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail
to izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- template support for help pages
