------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas somewhere,
pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>, and
remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "development
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.

coming *soon*:

coming *next*:
- form(s) to edit label sheets (for PSLabels)
- form(s) to edit tech data (colors, commercials, mtypes, pict, tone)

coming *sometimes* (maybe):
- add confirmation to disk type deletion
- movie language setting(s)
- store user-based preferences into a different table if no cookies are used
- add "sample-links" to translation editor
- enable/disable a category (to temporarily get rid of unwanted ones)
- new database field: "lent to" (to find out where your media *really* are :)
- make menu template-driven
- configurable format of counter display: as is in db / in minutes / in hh:mm
  (same for length field)
- making out-sourcing of security relevant files (inc/*) possible
  (to e.g. put those files outside the web tree)
