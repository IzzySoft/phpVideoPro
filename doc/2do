------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas somewhere,
pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>, and
remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "development
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

coming *soon*:
- statistics page
- translation for categories missing
- menue items for "change MediaNr" and "change MediaType"

coming *next*:
- search function
- overview "per tape" (should look equivalent to taperest)
- find duplicate movies

coming *sometimes* (maybe):
- add admin menu (search/delete orphans, backup/restore DB, etc.)
- new database field: "lent to" (to find out where your media *really* are :)
- making categories editable (user-defined categories etc.)
- make menu template-driven
- adding *all* media types to cass table. This requires a new field
  (mtype) as well - and maybe we rename the table :)
- configurable format of counter display: as is in db / in minutes / in hh:mm
  (same for length field)
- making out-sourcing of security relevant files (inc/*) possible
  (to e.g. put those files outside the web tree)
