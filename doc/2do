------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas somewhere,
pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>, and
remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "development
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Focus:
- settings for NTSC/PAL
- "enhanced" [url] and [img] tags (like we use in phpDiveLog already)

Not scheduled (yet):
- add Audio/Subtitle to filter settings
- export-button for selected movie (view_entry) and selected movies (movie list)
  for transfer, similiar to a "partial backup"
- table names: consequent use of the pvp_ prefix for all tables (for users
  who only have one database with their provider)
- separate the view_entry template from the edit template to move all formating
  information from the PHP code into the template
- more optional "Bubble Help" (via HTML "TITLE" attribute)

Interesting things not scheduled at all:
- support for file-based formats like DivX, including play controls
  (links to start external Shell scripts, *.Cmd files or the like)
- PlugIn structure for 3rd party addons (like the PS templates), making PVP
  more modular and allowing removal of unwanted features
- PS template(s) for DVD covers
- form(s) to edit label sheets (for PSLabels)
- storing the movies IMDB ID into the db, if known
- movie rating (0-5 stars where 0 is "not rated yet"), also in list (providing
  the possibility to "order by rating")
- honour date format settings in all places
- add "sample-links" to translation editor
- new database field: "lent to" (to find out where your media *really* are :)
- make menu template-driven
- configurable format of counter display: as is in db / in minutes / in hh:mm
  (same for length field)
- making out-sourcing of security relevant files (inc/*) possible
  (to e.g. put those files outside the web tree)
