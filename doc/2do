------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ToDo-List in general has no fixed order: I just add new ideas on the
bottom, pick the next item by using some brain-based random() function <grin>,
and remove completed tasks from this list. So *any* of the items listed below
could be the next to be implemented - or stay in this list for, huh, eternity
(except some items on top that are somehow scheduled). If you think there's
something missing in this list, feel free to add an item on the feature request
list on my project page on sourceforge - or just write a mail to my "develoment
account" izzysoft@qumran.org.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

coming *around* 0.2.0 (not yet sure if before or after):
- fields for counter settings (start/end of movie for old tape recorders
  (feature request by user via sourceforge))
- splitting date field into day-month-year

coming *after* 0.2.0:
- limit list display to user-definable amount of data sets
- print lists function taking into account a user-definable page length
- label creating and printing function
- search function
- new database field: "lent to" (to find out where your media *really* are :)
