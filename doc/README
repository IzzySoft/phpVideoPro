This is the README file I wrote for phpVideoPro v0.0.3. As you may know,
programmers get very lazy on writing documentation - so starting with point
3.), the information in this file may or may not fit newer versions, since I
may have forgotten to update it. Don't be angry at me if this happens - just
drop me a note about this - or even better, update this file (if you know
the missing/changed information) and send it back to me, so I can replace it
in the package :)

More documentation may follow (or not - see above ;) in the future. But I'm
more concerned about new features and, if needed, bugfixes to come asap, so
again I may forget about the documentation - since it doesn't have that high
priority for me :)

So I hope you can cope with this code, and wish you good luck - and enjoy
phpVideoPro!

1.) CopyRight (and CopyLeft)
----------------------------

  This nice piece of software is (c) 2001 by Itzchak Rehberg and IzzySoft, and
  is protected by the Gnu Public License Version 2 (GPL). In short, this means:
  - you'll have the source code available (humm - it's PHP, so what shall I
    do? :)
  - you may run this program on as many machines as you want/have
  - you may copy and distribute it as much as you want - as long as you don't
    take money for it (and keep all files together!)
  - you may edit this code to fit your needs/wishes (please, let me know about
    improvements!)
  - you may use this code for own applications - but they have to be released
    under GPL then as well.
  For details, please read the file named LICENSE in the doc/ directory.

===============================================================================

2.) Warranty
------------

  This program is provided "as is" with no warranty (see GPL Par. 11).
  Especially this means, that the aothor is not responsible for any damages
  caused by the use of this software - explicitly or implicitly. The only thing
  I can guarantee you is: it will consume some disk space :)

===============================================================================

3.) Requirements
----------------

 There are a few things you have to make sure first (without them the whole
 program, including this setup, won't work at all):
 1. have a webserver running (I just tested it with Apache)
 2. have PHP running, at least v4.0b3 (a version less than this won't work;
    I recommend using Apache with PHP as loadable module, and that's
    the only combination I've tested)
 3. make sure your PHP has MySQL support built in! (if requirements
    1. and 2. are met, point your browser to the setup/phpinfo.php file via
    http to see what features are supported by your PHP setup)
 4. point your browser the setup/index.php page via http (so that this page is
    parsed by PHP). At this time, only Netscape is tested to work with
    phpVideoPro (probably M$ Internet Exploder will work as well). Konqueror is
    known as *NOT* working (version 1.9.8 - higher versions may work but are
    not tested yet) - though it works for the setup program

===============================================================================

4.) Pre-Requisites / Installation
---------------------------------

 If above mentioned requirements are met, we can start setting up phpVideoPro.
 To do this, follow these steps:
 1. unpack the tarball to a directory of your choice. It has to be located
    below your webservers document root (or you have to configure your
    webserver in a way it can use that directory, e.g. by creating an alias).
    Simple advice: use "tar xzf <tarfile>" to unpack it into the current
    directory. Probably you have already done this - otherwise you would not
    be able to read this file :)
 2. edit inc/config.inc to reflect your structures. Don't change anything
    below the hashed line, since these are only global internal settings
    (so if you change something here, you may "break" the program).
    Essential settings you <b>must</b> make sure to reflect your structures
    are:
    - $base_url : the root directory of your phpVideoPro copy.
      make sure it has a leading slash (i.e. it has to be the complete
      path starting with your web servers document root) as well as a
      trailing slash.
    - $database : settings for the database (host running the db server,
      database name, user and password to access the database).
    The other settings you can leave unchanged, they have suitable defaults.
    you may change them in the future if you feel any need to :)
 3. create the database with the name you specified in inc/config.inc as
    $database["database"] on the host you configured there. Make sure the
    configured user has at least following privileges for this database:
    Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Create. For future versions (updates),
    the privileges Alter, Drop and References may also be needed.
 4. now, point your browser to <phpvideopro>/setup/index.php, read almost
    the same advices again to make sure everything is prepared (*grin*),
    and then click on the "create" link on the bottom of that page. More
    explanations follow there.

===============================================================================

5.) Download and Sites
----------------------

  First, you'll find a home page as well as a running demo (which may not
  always be current) on my home page, together with the pages for my other
  projects: http://www.qumran.org/homes/izzy/ or on Sourceforge,
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/videopro/ - on both sides you'll also find
  tarballs to download.
  If you have questions/suggestions, you can also contact me via email, using
  the address izzysoft@buntspecht.de - and please, don't give up waiting if I
  do not respond that quickly; it sometimes takes me a while :)
