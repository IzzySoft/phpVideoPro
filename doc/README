This is the README file I wrote for phpVideoPro v0.1.3 (and updated for v0.2.5).
As you may know, programmers get very lazy on writing documentation - so
starting with point 3.), the information in this file may or may not fit newer
versions, since I may have forgotten to update it. Don't be angry at me if this
happens - just drop me a note about this - or even better, update this file (if
you know the missing/changed information) and send it back to me, so I can
replace it in the package :)

More documentation may follow (or not - see above ;) in the future, some even
is already contained in the help system. But I'm more concerned about new
features and, if needed, bugfixes to come asap, so again I may forget about
the documentation - since it doesn't have that high priority for me :)

So I hope you can cope with this code, and wish you good luck - and enjoy
phpVideoPro!

1.) CopyRight (and CopyLeft)
----------------------------

  This nice piece of software is (c) 2001,2002 by Itzchak Rehberg and IzzySoft,
  and is protected by the Gnu Public License Version 2 (GPL). In short, this
  means:
  - you'll have the source code available
  - you may run this program on as many machines as you want/have
  - you may copy and distribute it as much as you want - as long as you don't
    take money for it (and keep all files together!)
  - you may edit this code to fit your needs/wishes (please, let me know about
    improvements!)
  - you may use this code for own applications - but they have to be released
    under GPL then as well.
  For details, please read the file named LICENSE in the doc/ directory.
  If you release this program e.g. in a bundle of software on CD/DVD, release
  an article about this program etc, let the author know about this. Not that
  you need an explicit permission (as long as you stick to the above terms,
  especially the GPL) - you are even encouraged to do so. I just want to be
  informed about the fact to be up-to-date about all PR taking place ;).

===============================================================================

2.) Warranty
------------

  This program is provided "as is" with no warranty (see GPL Par. 11).
  Especially this means, that the aothor is not responsible for any damages
  caused by the use of this software - explicitly or implicitly. The only thing
  I can guarantee you is: it will consume some disk space :)

===============================================================================

3.) Requirements
----------------

 There are a few things you have to make sure first (without them the whole
 program, including this setup, won't work at all):
 1. have a webserver running (I just tested it with Apache)
 2. have PHP running, at least v4.0b3 (a version less than this won't work;
    I recommend using Apache with PHP as loadable module, and that's
    the only combination I've tested)
 3. make sure your PHP has built in support for the database you want to use
    (this has to be one supported by the program, of course)! (if requirements
    1. and 2. are met, point your browser to the setup/phpinfo.php file via
    http to see what features are supported by your PHP setup)
 4. point your browser the setup/index.php page via http (so that this page is
    parsed by PHP).

===============================================================================

4.) Pre-Requisites / Installation
---------------------------------

 If above mentioned requirements are met, we can start setting up phpVideoPro.
 To do this, follow these steps:
 1. unpack the tarball to a directory of your choice. It has to be located
    below your webservers document root (or you have to configure your
    webserver in a way it can use that directory, e.g. by creating an alias).
    Simple advice: use "tar xzf <tarfile>" to unpack it into the current
    directory. Probably you have already done this - otherwise you would not
    be able to read this file :)
 2. edit inc/config.inc to reflect your structures. Don't change anything
    below the hashed line, since these are only global internal settings
    (so if you change something here, you may "break" the program).
    Essential settings you <b>must</b> make sure to reflect your structures
    are:
    - $base_url : the root directory of your phpVideoPro copy.
      make sure it has a leading slash (i.e. it has to be the complete
      path starting with your web servers document root) as well as a
      trailing slash.
    - $base_path: same as $base_url, but for the file system (so for
      Windoze this one starts with the drive letter)
    - $database : settings for the database (host running the db server,
      database name, user and password to access the database).
    The other settings you can leave unchanged, they have suitable defaults.
    you may change them in the future if you feel any need to :)
 3. create the database with the name you specified in inc/config.inc as
    $database["database"] on the host you configured there. Make sure the
    configured user has at least following privileges for this database:
    Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Create. For future versions (updates),
    the privileges Alter, Drop and References may also be needed.
 4. now, point your browser to <phpvideopro>/setup/index.php, read almost
    the same advices again to make sure everything is prepared (*grin*),
    and then click on the "create" link on the bottom of that page. More
    explanations follow there.

===============================================================================

5.) Updating
------------

  When updating from a previous version of phpVideoPro, the steps to do
  follow easier rules. After updating the files (and checking config.inc for
  possible changes), point your browser to the setup/index.php and just
  follow the update link there.

===============================================================================

6.) Known bugs / limitations
----------------------------

  Since filter settings are simply stored into the db now, it gets difficult
  if multiple users run the program - and may lead to curious (and untested :)
  effects if they do this at the very same time. For now, I can only tell you
  to be aware of this. I thought about storing them into cookies - but in this
  case the settings are only valid as long as you don't close your browser
  (and the settings cannot be stored between sessions), so this would just be
  "changing limitations" but not removing them. Maybe I'll think about a
  solution for "multi-user environment" at some point in the future - for the
  next time this limitation will persist.
  Any bugs are not known to me - I didn't find any, and nobody reported anything :)

===============================================================================

7.) Download and Sites
----------------------

  First, you'll find a home page as well as a running demo (which may not
  always be current) on my home page, together with the pages for my other
  projects: http://www.qumran.org/homes/izzy/ or on Sourceforge,
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/videopro/ - on both sides you'll also find
  tarballs to download. The tarball of the latest available version should
  always be available by an "alias":
  http://www.qumran.org/ftp/net/div/izzysoft/phpvideopro.tgz should always
  point to the gnu-zipped tarball of the latest version (hopefully - if I
  didn't forget to update that link :)
  If you have questions/suggestions, you can also contact me via email, using
  the address izzysoft@qumran.org - and please, don't give up waiting if I
  do not respond that quickly; it sometimes takes me a while :)
