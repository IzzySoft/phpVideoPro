To not forget all those who support the project - hope I didn't forget somebody:

* The Beta-Testers and Bug-Reporters, especially Peter Bieringer for testing
  and help with PostgreSQL, and Michael Hasselberg for pointing out Bugs (if
  there were a "most reported award", it would belong to him!)
* all the language support files generators: Tsvetanka Stoyanova for Bulgarian,
  Annette for French, Alessandro Danti for Italian, Knut Fjellheim for Norwegian,
  Leszek Boroch and Jacek Wolski for Polish, Tom Albers for Dutch, Tony Granberg
  for Swedish
* SourceForge and Freshmeat for hosting the project (well, and some other
  sites promoting it)
* the Zend Team for giving us PHP, the MySQL and PostgreSQL teams for the
  databases
* Linus Torvalds (and all the Linux teams) for the development and runtime
  platform
* and all other supporters I may have forgotten at this place
