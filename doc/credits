To not forget all those who support the project - hope I didn't forget somebody:

* Peter Bieringer for testing and help with PostgreSQL
* all the language support files generators: Tsvetanka Stoyanova for Bulgarian,
  Annette for French, Alessandro Danti for Italian, Knut Fjellheim for Norwegian,
  Leszek Boroch for Polish, Tom Albers for Dutch, Tony Granberg for Swedish
* SourceForge and Freshmeat for hosting the project (well, and some other
  sites promoting it)
* the Zend Team for giving us PHP, the MySQL and PostgreSQL teams for the
  databases
* Linus Torvalds (and all the Linux teams) for the development and runtime
  platform
* and all other supporters I may have forgotten at this place
