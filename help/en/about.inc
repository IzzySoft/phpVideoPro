  <P Align=Justify>This is phpVideoPro version <? echo $version ?>, (c) 2001 by
   Itzchak Rehberg, all rights (and links) reserved. Inspired by my long-time
   favorite software for this purpose, VideoPro (c) 1991-94 by Bernd Rickers, I
   started developing my own video management program - since on one hand
   VideoPro was just available as a DOS based clipper application, and on the
   other hand some now important features like support for DVDs and tone
   formats like Dolby Digital 5.1 where missing, and Bernd stopped development
   in 1994. I decided for PHP not only as a platform independent programming
   language, plus this way I would have all my data available from
   everywhere, in the worst case by visiting some internet cafe :-)</P>
  <P Align=Justify>At this stage, phpVideoPro is intended for a single user
   environment. This may change with some future version - but don't expect
   multi user capabilities in the very close future...</P>
  <P ALIGN=Justify><b>So what features does phpVideoPro provide?</b> As a
   video management software it is of course intended to manage your (private)
   movies collection (it does not aim to manage a video shop, where multiple
   copies of the same medium can exist). You can add and change entries, display
   a list containing all entries or display a list of available free space on
   your video tapes - and phpVideoPro distinguishes between DVD, Original
   VideoTapes (OVT - these are the ones you bought or got as a present) and
   Recorded VideoTapes (RVT - these are the ones you recorded yourself).
   Moreover, filter functions help you to select subsets or find special
   entries even in large collections.</P>
  <P Align=Justify>New features are planned, and development still goes on.
   The frequency of new releases is not very steady and probably won't ever be -
   since "it's only a hobby", and there are so many others that require my
   presence :) But as long as I have not added all the features <b>I</b> need,
   you can be sure that there will always be a fresh release available within
   the next few weeks! So I close with my standard disclaimer: "This is only a
   hobby, I can't promise anything - I just ask you to stay tuned..."</P>
