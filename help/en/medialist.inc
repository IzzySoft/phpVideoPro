[title]
List of registered media

[text]
This displays a list containing all movies stored in your database, per default
sorted by "*mediatype#" and "*medianr#". You may change the order of items
displayed just by clicking on the table header of the column you want to sort
by. If you have set up some filters, they are used to select these entries - so
in this case only movies matching the filters are displayed.
[text]
Since this list can become quite long, we split it to multiple pages. How many
lines of data should be displayed per page, you may configure via the item
"*display_limit#" on the "<A HREF="{PHP_SELF}?topic=configuration">*configuration#</A>"
page.
[text]
From within this list, you can select a single item to display details of, and
from within that detail screen you may decide to <A HREF="{PHP_SELF}?topic=add_entry">edit</A>
or even delete the entry.
