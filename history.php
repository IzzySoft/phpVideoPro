  <LI><b>0.0.2 (June 2001)</b><br>
      database completely reworked and restructured to what I felt to be
      suitable to fit the new requirements. Detail view largely improved.
      New available functions:
      <ul>
       <li>improved Detail View (old one dropped :)
       <li>possibility to change existing movie data
       <li>added (this) history page
      </ul>
  <LI><b>0.0.1 (January 2001)</b><br>
      initial version - just allowed browsing of existing data, no changes
      are made to data. Features available:
      <ul>
       <li>MediaList
       <li>Detail View
       <li>About
      </ul>
