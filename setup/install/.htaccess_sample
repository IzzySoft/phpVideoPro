# Sample .htaccess file to protect this directory. If you want to use it:
# 1) check the file location specified for "AuthUserFile", since you may
#    want to change it. Make sure it is not inside your webtree. Of course
#    you can use a Realm (AuthName) that is already defined on your system:
#    If that's the case, and no new users should be added here, skip the next
#    item and go directly to 3)
# 2) You may need to create the AuthUserFile and/or add new users to it (i.e.
#    the users who should be able to access this directory with their browsers).
#    Make sure you have the right privileges (be root).
#    In the following examples, we go to add a user named "john" to the password
#    list. If the file does not yet exist, you must enter
#       htpasswd -cp <AuthUserFile> john
#    If it already exists (i.e. for every additional user), it is the same
#    command but without the "c" parameter:
#       htpasswd -p <AuthUserFile> john
#    In both cases, you will be prompted for the password (hence the "p"
#    option). See "man htpasswd" for more detailed information.
# 3) Now all pre-requisites solved, you can rename this file (you are reading
#    now) to ".htaccess" (and optionally remove all lines starting with a "#"):
#       mv .htaccess_sample .htaccess
# 4) That's it - try if it works by pointing your browser to this directory.
#    A password dialog should pop up (yeah, that's what we wanted!). Enter the
#    user information (in our example "john" and the password you specified
#    on the prompt), and the server should let you in.
